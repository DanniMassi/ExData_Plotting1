## Brief Overview

This repo holds my worked solutions for the Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 1. The following are the instructions on how to run the R scripts:

- Set the working directory in R
- Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
- Unzip to a subdirectory called "data" within the working directory
- Run the scripts as plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R or plot4.R

Each of the scripts with generate a corresponding .png file with the names plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png respectively.
